This is in Alpha.
It a tools intended for static sites. It makes files smaller. There are other tools that do the same thing. But this is the one I wrote. I made for my needs but maybe you will like it too.

It used Zopfli and Brotli for general file compression. It currently uses Optipng and Jpegoptim for image compression.

This software was not tested on animals. Or in any way really.
